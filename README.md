# PipeR-us

For a unit in second year of university (2015) I had to create a customer ordering system for a company PipeR'us using Java on NetBeans 8 Environment along with a partner.

Also had to create a Graphical User Interface for it.

The graphics side was developed using AWT & Swing.

I was mainly tasked to code the back-end of the ordering system as well aided the GUI.
