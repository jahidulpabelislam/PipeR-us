# PipeR'us

For a unit in the second year of university (2015) I along with a partner were tasked  to create a customer ordering system for a company PipeR'us.

The system required a Graphical User Interface with good usability for it, which was built using AWT & Swing.

I was mainly tasked to code the back-end of the ordering system as well aided the GUI.
  
Another requirement was to use Java on the NetBeans 8 Environment for the development of this.
